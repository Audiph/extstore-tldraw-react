# TLDraw React Sample

A simple app replicated from BasicExample.tsx of [TLDraw](https://github.com/tldraw/tldraw) to be used in EXT Store.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

1. Do an `npm install` to install dependencies
2. Test it using `npm start`
3. Do `npm run build` and a _build_ folder will be generated.
4. Make sure that you'll only copy **index.html** and **static folder**
